Slide 2: The Stages of CI/CD

Title: What are the main stages of a CI/CD pipeline and how do they work?
Bullet points:
The trigger: The event that initiates the pipeline, such as a code commit, a pull request, or a scheduled time
Code checkout: The process of fetching the latest code from the source code repository
Compile the code: The process of transforming the source code into executable code
Run unit tests: The process of verifying the functionality and quality of the code using automated tests
Package the code: The process of bundling the code and its dependencies into a deployable artifact, such as a jar, a war, or a docker image
Run acceptance tests: The process of validating the functionality and quality of the artifact using automated tests
Delivery or deployment: The process of releasing the artifact to a target environment, such as staging, production, or a customer site
Examples:

A code snippet showing the configuration of the CI/CD pipeline using a tool like Jenkins, GitLab, or AWS CodePipeline

Slide 2: The Trigger

Title: What is the trigger and why is it important?
Bullet points:
The trigger is the event that initiates the CI/CD pipeline, such as a code commit, a pull request, or a scheduled time
The trigger ensures that the pipeline runs automatically and frequently, without manual intervention
The trigger enables faster feedback and delivery, as well as better collaboration and visibility
The trigger can be configured to run on specific branches, tags, or conditions
Examples:
A screenshot of a GitHub pull request triggering a CI/CD pipeline
A diagram showing the different types of triggers and their effects
Slide 3: Code Checkout

Title: What is code checkout and why is it important?
Bullet points:
Code checkout is the process of fetching the latest code from the source code repository
Code checkout ensures that the pipeline uses the most updated and consistent version of the code
Code checkout enables better quality and reliability, as well as easier debugging and troubleshooting
Code checkout can be configured to use specific branches, tags, or commits
Examples:
A screenshot of a Git command fetching the latest code from a remote repository
A diagram showing the relationship between the local and remote repositories and the code checkout process
Slide 4: Compile the Code

Title: What is code compilation and why is it important?
Bullet points:
Code compilation is the process of transforming the source code into executable code
Code compilation ensures that the code is syntactically correct and free of errors
Code compilation enables better performance and security, as well as easier deployment and integration
Code compilation can be configured to use specific tools, frameworks, or languages
Examples:
A screenshot of a Maven command compiling a Java project into a jar file
A diagram showing the input and output of the code compilation process and the tools used
Slide 5: Run Unit Tests

Title: What are unit tests and why are they important?
Bullet points:
Unit tests are automated tests that verify the functionality and quality of the code at the smallest level, such as a function or a class
Unit tests ensure that the code meets the specifications and requirements, and that it does not introduce any bugs or regressions
Unit tests enable better maintainability and reusability, as well as easier refactoring and debugging
Unit tests can be configured to use specific tools, frameworks, or libraries
Examples:
A screenshot of a JUnit test case running on a Java class
A diagram showing the structure and scope of unit tests and the tools used
Slide 6: Package the Code

Title: What is code packaging and why is it important?
Bullet points:
Code packaging is the process of bundling the code and its dependencies into a deployable artifact, such as a jar, a war, or a docker image
Code packaging ensures that the artifact is self-contained and consistent, and that it can run on any environment
Code packaging enables better portability and scalability, as well as easier deployment and integration
Code packaging can be configured to use specific tools, frameworks, or formats
Examples:
A screenshot of a Docker command building a docker image from a Dockerfile
A diagram showing the components and structure of a code package and the tools used
Slide 7: Run Acceptance Tests

Title: What are acceptance tests and why are they important?
Bullet points:
Acceptance tests are automated tests that validate the functionality and quality of the artifact at the highest level, such as a user interface or a system
Acceptance tests ensure that the artifact meets the expectations and needs of the end users and stakeholders, and that it does not introduce any defects or issues
Acceptance tests enable better usability and reliability, as well as easier verification and validation
Acceptance tests can be configured to use specific tools, frameworks, or scenarios
Examples:
A screenshot of a Selenium test case running on a web application
A diagram showing the input and output of the acceptance tests and the tools used


Slide 9: What is delivery or deployment and why is it important?

Title: What is delivery or deployment and why is it important?
Bullet points:
Delivery or deployment is the process of releasing the artifact to a target environment, such as staging, production, or a customer site
Delivery or deployment ensures that the artifact is available and accessible to the end users and stakeholders, and that it meets the business objectives and expectations
Delivery or deployment enables better customer satisfaction and value, as well as easier monitoring and maintenance
Delivery or deployment can be configured to use specific tools, strategies, or techniques
Examples:
A screenshot of a AWS CodeDeploy command deploying a docker image to an EC2 instance
A diagram showing the flow and stages of the delivery or deployment process and the tools used
Slide 10: What are the challenges of delivery or deployment and how to overcome them?

Title: What are the challenges of delivery or deployment and how to overcome them?
Bullet points:
Some of the common challenges of delivery or deployment are:
Downtime: The loss of availability or functionality of the artifact during the delivery or deployment process
Errors: The occurrence of defects or issues in the artifact or the environment during or after the delivery or deployment process
Rollbacks: The need to revert the artifact or the environment to a previous state due to the failure of the delivery or deployment process
Some of the best practices to overcome these challenges are:
Use standard operating environment: Ensure that the artifact and the environment are consistent and compatible across different stages and platforms
Adopt continuous integration and delivery: Ensure that the artifact is tested and verified frequently and automatically throughout the development lifecycle
Enable automated rollbacks: Ensure that the artifact and the environment can be restored quickly and easily in case of any failure or issue
Examples:
A screenshot of a downtime alert or an error message during or after the delivery or deployment process
A diagram showing the steps and tools for performing an automated rollback
Slide 11: What are the types and techniques of delivery or deployment and how to choose them?

Title: What are the types and techniques of delivery or deployment and how to choose them?
Bullet points:
There are two main types of delivery or deployment:
Continuous delivery: The practice of delivering the artifact to a staging or pre-production environment that is similar to the production environment
Continuous deployment: The practice of delivering the artifact directly to the production environment without any manual intervention
There are several techniques of delivery or deployment, such as:
Rolling deployments: The technique of delivering the artifact to a subset of servers or users at a time, while keeping the rest of the servers or users on the previous version
Blue-green deployments: The technique of delivering the artifact to a parallel environment that is identical to the production environment, and then switching the traffic between the two environments
Canary deployments: The technique of delivering the artifact to a small percentage of servers or users, and then gradually increasing the percentage based on the feedback and metrics
The choice of the type and technique of delivery or deployment depends on several factors, such as:
The complexity and frequency of the artifact and the changes
The risk and impact of the delivery or deployment on the users and the business
The availability and capacity of the resources and the tools
Examples:
A screenshot of a continuous delivery or deployment dashboard or report
A diagram showing the architecture and the flow of the rolling, blue-green, or canary deployments
